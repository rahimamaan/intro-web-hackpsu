Welcome to HTML! Every website you use is made up of HTML - it's the building
blocks of the web. In this workshop, you'll learn how to use HTML (and some
other nifty technologies) to build your own websites and share them with the
world. Let's dive in!

The first thing we'll cover is comments. This file, believe it or not, is HTML.
You can (and will!) open it in a browser; when you make changes to this file,
they'll show up when you refresh the page. If you open this web page in your web
browser, all you'll see displayed is the text "Hello, world!" You won't see this
explanation at all. That's because I've commented these paragraphs out.

Commenting something means I'm telling the browser not to display it. This will
let me explain concepts without having my explanation show up in the HTML you'll
learn to write. If you want to see what the HTML would look like without
comments, open bare.html in the same directory.

To comment something, surround it with the text you see on lines 1 and 20. HTML
doesn't let you put comments inside of comments.

<!--
What's the smallest HTML document there is? You're looking at it! (Well, you
would be if all these comments were gone ._.) All a browser needs to understand
your HTML is something called a *doctype*. Treat it like a magic incantation -
as long as you have <!DOCTYPE html> as the very first thing, your browser will
know you're writing HTML.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>



<!--
After this, you can put (almost) whatever text you want and your browser will
display it.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Change the text from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, $YOUR_NAME" (replacing that
   with your actual name).
2) Refresh the page.
3) Is there anything else you can type that *doesn't* get displayed verbatim?
   Hint: think about the what the comments and doctype have in common.
-->

Hello, world!


<!--
Congratulations! You just made your first HTML page. If you finish with this
before everyone else, open section 02's index.html and start reading.
