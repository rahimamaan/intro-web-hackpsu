/**
In addition to changing colors, you can change the fonts and font sizes of
elements as well. The properties you'll use are:

* font-family: Set what font you want to use (Arial, Times New Roman, etc)
* font-size: Set how big or small the text should be.
* line-height: Space between lines of text. Think single-spaced or double-spaced
               but with any multiplier.
* letter-spacing: Space between individual letters.
* text-align: Left-, center-, right-aligned, or justified text.

You have two different ways of specifying how big something can be. You can use
pixel measurements, which are *absolute*. One pixel is one dot on your computer
screen. Or you can use ems, which are *relative* to the current height of the
text.

Generally, you want to use ems for all your measurements because it lets you
avoid doing math when you say how big or small things should be.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Make a CSS rule that sets the font-family of both <h1> and <p> elements to
   "Times New Roman" (including the quotes).
2) Center the <h1> element in the middle of the page by setting the "text-align"
   to "center".
3) Make the <p> double-spaced by setting its "line-height" to "2em" (remember,
   1em is the current height of text; 2em is twice the current height).
