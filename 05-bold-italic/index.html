<!--
Up next on "Tags You Should Know" (airing 9pm EST on the Discovery Channel) are
the <strong> and <em> tags. These tags bold and italicize their content,
respectively. You can use them just like paragraph and heading tags, but unlike
those tags, <strong> and <em> don't automatically make linebreaks. Practical
example:

===
<p>Let's <h4>emphasize</h4> words</p>
===

gets displayed as

===
Let's
*emphasize*
words
===

while

===
<p>Let's <strong>emphasize</strong> words</p>
===

gets displayed as

===
Let's *emphasize* words
===

Most of the time, you'll want your bold and italicized words to be in the same
line as the rest of your text, so <strong> and <em> are what you'll use.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Add <strong> and <em> tags to the HTML I've already written. Be sure to close
   all your tags! (What happens if you don't?)
2) Refresh the page in your browser. What do you see? What happens if you put a
   <strong> tag inside an <em> tag, or vice versa?

<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream: Act V, Scene I</h1>
<h2>Robin:</h2>
<p>If we shadows have offended</p>
<p>Think but this and all is mended:</p>
<p>That you have but slumbered here</p>
<p>While these visions did appear.</p>
<p>And this weak and idle theme,</p>
<p>No more yielding but a dream.</p>
