        <title>Section 11: Stylesheets</title>
<!--
*CSS*, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that you use to describe
how your web pages should look. The *sheets* (like styles.css in this folder)
are files that contain CSS. We'll cover *cascading* and *style* in later
sections.

To connect stylesheets with web pages, you'll use an HTML tag called <link>, not
to be confused with the <a> tag that links between web pages (this is confusing
and there's no real reason for it other than "historical compatibility"). To
reiterate:

* To link between web pages, use the <a> tag.
* To add a stylesheet to your web page, use the <link> tag.

Again, this is confusing and you'll just have to memorize it. Sorry.

Let's go ahead add a stylesheet. I've already written one for this section;
you'll be writing the HTML to add it to the web page. Like I mentioned above,
the tag you'll be using to add a stylesheet is <link>. It has two required
attributes: `rel`, which is always "stylesheet", and `href`, which is the
address of the stylesheet you want to add.

The last thing to know about <link> tags is that they, like <img> tags, are
self-closing. Check back to section 08 if you don't remember what self-closing
means.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) In the <head> section, make a new <link /> self-closing tag.
2) Add a `rel` attribute with the value "stylesheet" to your link tag.
3) Add a `href` attribute with the value "styles.css".
4) Save and refresh the page. It should look way more colorful.
