<!--
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext just means "text that links
to other web pages." Any time you click on a link or button that takes you to
somewhere else, that's hypertext. A markup language is a type of programming
language that describes the meaning of different bits of text. It uses specially
formatted bits of text, called *tags*, to describe the other text that you want
to display in a browser. Tags are how browsers know that certain words are links
while other words are headers or paragraphs. HTML has certain rules, called
*syntax*, that you have to follow for browsers to understand what you're trying
to do.

While you'll eventually need to know all of these syntax rules by heart, for now
we'll learn them one at a time. You'll be an HTML artist before you know it!

You already know one rule: the first thing in an HTML document has to be a
doctype. We'll add another rule to that: the second thing in an HTML document
has to be a <html> opening tag, the last thing in an HTML document has to be
a </html> closing tag, and any text you want to show up in a browser has to be
between those opening and closing tags.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) In the space below, make four blank lines.
2) On the first line, put a doctype (see 01-hello-world/index.html if you've
   forgotten what the syntax for a doctype is).
3) On the second line, put an opening html tag: <html>
4) On the fourth line, put a closing html tag: </html>
5) On the third line, write anything you want.
6) Refresh this page in your web browser!
