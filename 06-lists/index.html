Lists are how you indicate a collection of related things in HTML. Think about
shopping lists, recipe instructions, what you look for in a partner, or your
favorite bands. All of these and more can be displayed with lists.

Recall back to section 03 when we learned that tags can be *nested*, or be put
inside each other. HTML lists are always made up of nested tags: one tag that
tells the browser what kind of list it is, and another tag that indicates the
items in the list. HTML has two kinds of lists: ordered lists, which start at 1
and count up as you add items to the list, and unordered lists, which act like
bullet points. Ordered lists are useful for displaying things where the order
matters, like step-by-step instructions for a recipe. Unordered lists are useful
when you only care about the items in a collection, like a shopping list.

The tag name for ordered lists is <ol>, unordered lists is <ul>, and list items
is <li>. Here's an example of what a list looks like:

===
<ul>
    <li>
        First item
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Second</em> item
    </li>
    <li>
        Third item
    </li>
</ul>
===

This gets displayed like

===
* First item
* _Second_ item
* Third item
===

If we replaced the <ul>...</ul> with <ol>...</ol> but kept the list items the
same, it'd get displayed like this:

===
1. First item
2. _Second_ item
3. Third item
===

You can put anything you want inside of a <li> - even other lists! Just always
remember to close any tags you open; most recently opened tag gets closed first.
As you nest tags deeper and deeper, it becomes easy to forget to close
everything correctly, and this is the #1 source of bugs when you write HTML.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Using ordered lists, teach me how to make a PB&J sandwich.
2) Using unordered lists, describe five characteristics you like most about
   yourself.
3) For each list item in your PB&J recipe, put an unordered list containing all
   the ingredients, utensils, and other things you use in each step. Italicize
   the edible things. Bold the kitchen utensils. Leave everything else normal.
