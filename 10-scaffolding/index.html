<!--
Before we jump into CSS, though, there's one more thing we need to cover about
HTML. So far, we've just put everything in between our <html> and </html> tags,
but technically, this isn't valid HTML. There are actually two more parts to a
HTML page that we need to know about.

Every page is divided into two parts: the <head> and the <body>. The <head>
contains *metadata*, or information about the page content. Tags in the <body>
contain the actual page content that gets shown to the browser. Everything that
you've written so far would go in the <body>, so the only thing new is <head>.

One of the cool things about the <head> is that it's where you set the webpage
*title*, which is what gets shown in title bar of the browser.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) In the space below, before the <body> tags, add an opening <head> tag.
2) On the line after that, indent and make a <title></title> tag. Write "Section
   10: Scaffolding" in between the opening and closing title tags.
3) On the line after that, close the </head> tag.
4) Refresh the page and check the title bar of your browser. You should see
   "Hello, title" there (and not on the webpage).

    <p>Hello, world!</p>
