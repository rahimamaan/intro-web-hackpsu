<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<!--
Recap from section 02: your web pages have to have a doctype and opening/closing
<html> tags. I went ahead and added them to this page and all later pages, but
don't forget to include it on any web page you make yourself!

Now, let's learn about HTML tags. Back in section 01, you might have tried to
write something like this:

===
<!DOCTYPE html>

Hello, world!
This is a second line below the first.
===

But if you opened that in a browser, it'll get displayed like this

===
Hello, world! This is a second line before the first.
===

totally ignoring the linebreak between the two sentences! That's because HTML
doesn't pay attention to newlines when it decides how things get displayed on
screen. Instead, it uses *tags* to describe the meaning of the text that it
displays. That's pretty abstract, so let's jump into an example of
one of the most common common tags you'll use when writing HTML - <p>, the
paragraph tag:
-->

<p>Hello, world!</p>

<!--
That's all a tag is! Anything inside "<" ">" is a tag, and the word inside that
is the tag name. All tags have the same form: the pair of opening (<p>) and
closing (</p>) tags with content (Hello, world!) in the middle. The name of a
tag tells the browser what type of thing the content is (e.g, a paragraph, a
heading, a link, or something else entirely) and the opening and closing tags
tell the browser where the content starts and stops.

In this example, we're telling the browser "Hey! This text, 'Hello, world!', is
a paragraph. If there's any special way the browser treats paragraphs, treat
this text the same way, because it's a paragraph. But only treat it like a
paragraph in between the <p> and </p> tags."

Tags have two other must-know properties:
1) They are like parentheses. If you open a tag, you have to close it.
2) They can *nest*, meaning you can have tags inside of tags. If you do this,
   you need to close tags in the right order: the latest tag opened is the first
   tag closed.

If you compare this file and the file from section 01, you'll notice that they
both look the same. That's because browsers automatically treat plain, untagged
text like it's a paragraph. But sometimes they get it wrong, so it's always best
to tell them explicitly.

Paragraphs are useful because browsers automatically know to put newlines in
between them. (How do they know? We'll learn that when we learn CSS!) Let's see
<p> in action. We're going to make a correct version of our failed earlier
example. We know that

===
Hello, world!
This is a second line below the first.
===

doesn't work. But what happens when we tell the browser that each of those lines
is their own paragraph?

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Comment out line 33. Uncomment lines 80-83.
2) Reload this file in your browser. The lines run together; that's not what we
   want.
3) Put paragraph tags (<p> and </p>) around each line.
4) Reload the file again. What happens to each line?
