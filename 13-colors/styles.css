/**
In the last section, we set some tags to have different colors with some pretty
odd names (what's a "lavenderblush"?). There are actually 140 different colors
defined in CSS, but what if you wanted to have more than 140 colors on your web
page (please don't do this)? Or more realistically, what if you wanted a color
that doesn't have a CSS name? Why, you make it yourself!

CSS can display millions more colors than it has names for, using something
called *hexadecimal values*, or *hex*, for short. Hex values are just regular
numbers, but in base-16. We count in base-10, which means each digit can be the
number 0-9. Hex digits can be the numbers 0-9 and the letters A-F. If you're not
already familiar with hex, don't worry - you can use *color pickers*, which are
apps that let you choose colors visually and then tell you what the hex value of
that color. http://www.colorpicker.com/ is a great resource to use. Hex colors
are six digits long.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Using a color picker, pick five different colors and write CSS declarations
   to set the "color" or "background-color" property of each of the tags below
   to a different color using hex.
