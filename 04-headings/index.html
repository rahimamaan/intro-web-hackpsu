We just learned about tags, and paragraph tags specifically. But the web would
be incredibly boring if we only had paragraphs to play around with. Good thing
there are literally hundreds of different tags for you to use! We'll learn about
a few useful tags to spice up your HTML.

First on the list are heading tags. Just like newspaper headings, HTML headings
tell the browser that their content is a title of a section of the webpage. The
first heading tag we'll use has the name <h1> (that's the letter h and the
number 1). Just like paragraphs, we surround the text we want to be a heading
with opening and closing <h1> tags.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Pick a short phrase that you want to turn into a heading, like for example
   "HackPSU is pretty freaking awesome because", and type that on a line below.
2) Put an opening <h1> tag before the phrase you just typed.
3) Put a closing </h1> tag after the phrase you just typed.
4) Refresh the page in your browser. You should see a big, bold rendition of the
   phrase you came up with!
5) Underneath your heading, make two new paragraphs using the <p> tag we learned
   in section 03.
6) Refresh the page again. Do you see a difference in how the heading and
   paragraphs are displayed?

It turns out there's more than one heading tag - in fact, there are six of them!
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. Somewhat unintuitively, the higher the
number goes, the smaller the heading is. <h1> is the largest heading, <h2> is
the second-largest, <h3> is the third-largest, and so on to <h6>, which is the
smallest.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Let's see how the other headings look. Come up with some text you want to
   turn into smaller headings (maybe things like "The food is delicious", "The
   workshops are gr8", "Everyone I've met is wonderful").
2) Like before, put some different header opening/closing tags before/after your
   phrases. Be sure to mix it up and use <h2>, <h3>, and <h4> at least once.
3) Put some paragraphs between your subheadings.
4) Refresh the page!
