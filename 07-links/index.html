Links (short for hyperlinks, found in hypertext, get hyped!) are how you get
from one webpage to another. If you've ever clicked on something and found
yourself somewhere else, you probably clicked on a link. You can link to
different parts of the same webpage, different webpages on the same website, or
to different websites entirely. At the risk of _hyper_bole (get it ??), links
might be the most important tag you learn about. Let's get to it!

The name of a link tag isn't link, like you'd expect. It's actually <a> (short
for "anchor" for historical reasons). A link looks like this in HTML:

<a href="http://example.com">Link to example.com</a>

But wait! What's that `href` thing? It's called an *attribute*. When you add an
attribute to a tag, it modifies how the browser treats that tag. All of the tag
types you learned about so far can take attributes, but they've been optional.
Links are the first tags that have a required attribute: href. (If you're
curious, it stands for Hypertext REFerence.)

The href *attribute value* (the thing after the equals sign) tells the browser
where to go when somebody clicks on the link. Syntax rule: all attribute values
must be wrapped in quotes. For links, you can

The tag content is the description of the link. It's what gets shown to the user
to click on.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Make an ordered list of your favorite five websites, with the title of the
   website as the tag content.
2) Refresh the page, and click on all of your links to make sure they work!
