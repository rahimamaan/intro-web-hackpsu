Now that we've learned about attributes, it's time to learn about another tag
that uses attributes - images. Let's jump in with a quick example.

<img src="https://placekitten.com/200/286" alt="A kitten!" />

The first thing to notice is that we have two required attributes, src and alt.
src is the address of the image. (Did you know every image has an address? Right-
click on an image and choose "Copy Image Address", and presto, you'll be able to
paste that address anywhere.) alt is the image's description. It's used in case
the image doesn't load for whatever reason, and for browsers used by blind
people.

The second thing about image tags is that they're *self-closing*. Every other
tag we've learned about has an opening and closing tag surrounding its content.
However, images are different. They display their content based on the `src`
and `alt` attributes, so there's no need to have anything as content. Instead,
it self-closes, which is indicated by the slash before the end of the opening
tag. This means you don't need to (and shouldn't) include a closing image tag.

NOW YOU TRY:
1) Open giphy.com and find a gif you like. Right-click on it and choose "Copy
   Image Address".
2) Using the address you just copied, make a new image tag below. Be sure to add
   an alt attribute that describes the image.
3) Refresh the page and enjoy your gif!
