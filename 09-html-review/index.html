You've learned a lot in a short time. We've gone over:

1) Doctypes and html
2) What tags are
3) Paragraphs and headings
4) Bold and italic text
5) Lists
6) Links and images

That makes up 80% of what you'll find on the internet, and 100% of what you'll
find on buzzfeed. So before we get into learning about CSS, let's review
everything we've learned so far by making our own buzzfeed-style article! Don't
be afraid to check back to previous sections or ask for help if you don't
remember how to do something.

1) Before we start, let's decide what we want our article to be about. Think of
   an appropriately gif-y topic, five examples of your topic, descriptions for
   each example, and hit up giphy.com to find five gifs that showcase your
   examples. If you're feeling uninspired, I recommend the topic "Why HackPSU is
   freaking awesome!" Write them down somewhere so you don't forget them while
   we set up our HTML.
2) Now that you have your topic, examples, gifs, and descriptions, we need to
   make a place to put them. First, let's turn the topic into a heading. Make a
   first-level heading with your topic as the content. Save and refresh your
   browser - you should see your topic, large and bold.
3) Buzzfeed is famous for its list articles, so next we'll need to make a list
   for our examples. Make an ordered list with five empty (content-less) list
   items inside it. When you save and refresh your browser, you should see five
   numbers in a list underneath the topic.
4) Now it's time to display your first example. Inside the first list item, make
   a third-level heading and put the example as the content. Underneath that,
   create an image tag with the gif address as the `src` attribute. Finally, put
   a paragraph tag under the image, with the example description as the content.
   Be sure to close all your tags correctly!
5) Do the same thing for the remaining four examples. Save and refresh the page,
   and you should see all your examples & gifs underneath the topic heading.
6) Let's give you some credit for this excellent article. After the list ends,
   make a paragraph that says "Created by $YOUR_NAME" (replacing $YOUR_NAME with
   your actual name). We're going to turn your name into a link to your website.
   Put an opening and closing link tag (check back to section 07 if you don't
   remember the link tag name) around your name, and set the `href` attribute to
   your personal site. Save and refresh - you should be able to click on
   $YOUR_NAME and have your browser take you to your personal site.

Woo! Congrats on your first full-featured HTML page. Believe it or not, this is
what most websites look like under the hood. In the next sections, we'll cover
how to make it look more like the websites you're used to seeing, using CSS.
